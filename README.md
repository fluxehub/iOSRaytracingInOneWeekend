Full implementation of the first [Raytraing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book (with additional ACES tonemapping), accelerated using Metal and the iPhone 15 Pro hardware raytracing features. Additional credit to Apple for the [SimplePathTracer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/metal_sample_code_library/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal) example project, which was an invaluable reference for the Metal raytracing API.

The code quality is not incredible as I chose compactness over abstraction, and there's an over-abundance of `!` instead of proper error handling. Nevertheless, it serves as a decent reference for basic raytracing in Metal.
